- All requirements have been implemented:

- How to run the project
  For Frontend: simply go into the front-end folder and after installing packages run the 'npm start'
  For back-end: Go to the backend folder and then another folder 'webshop_backend' and then run command 'python manage.py runserver'

  Used the templates for populate_db so you have to go to the "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" for index page, "http://127.0.0.1:8000/populate_db" and "http://127.0.0.1:8000/clear_db"

- In front-end I have accounts password change, useritems(sold, purchased, own items) , profile, and add item functionality is implemented in "profile.js"
